Hello Sunshine,
	Your drawing has convinced me, I am coming over to see your mom, brother and you! I can't wait to see your new skates, I bet you will go so fast in them that you are just like The Flash. I am so happy that we will all be together, it makes my heart feel so big and warm. Gran loves you so much, Adrian. When I am there we can make cookies like I promised last time. You be a good boy for your momma until I get there, okay?
