Emma, my angel you're am absolute genius!! Yes, you and I, we can run away! School doesn't matter at this point anyways, we can try to get a little place together somewhere or just wander around until… you know. As long as I can be with you then I know that we can face this fate standing side-by-side. I know that it won't be the grand future we could have had along side each other, but it's still us. When do you want to put this into action??
