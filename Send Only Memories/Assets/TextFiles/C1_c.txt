Marriah,
	It truly breaks my heart to read such a letter, especially in such despair times as these. I was truly hoping for a better response to my confession, perhaps even an admittance of your own; but I can see now that it was only my dying fantasy. In these final months of life as we know it, I had wanted to find comfort in my emotions and in a mutual love between us… it's just a shame that I see this isn't going to be the case. This news doesn't come to me as much of a shock considering you never gave me any reason to assume otherwise, but I still feel the sting of rejection as my eyes continually scan your letter. If anything, I hope that you can at least accept my feelings for you.
		Eternally Yours,
			Brian
