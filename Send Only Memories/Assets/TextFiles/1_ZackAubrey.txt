It's all a conspiracy, I just know it is. There is no way that this can all be true… it just has to be some big cover-up for a mistake… or maybe this is all just a test! I mean if the world was really ending then.. I mean then nothing would matter. Who would stop anyone from just doing whatever they wanted to do?! HOW MESSED UP IS IT FOR A METEOR TO BE WHAT ENDS US?!?! I mean, the fact alone that it's acting like an EMP or whatever… can it really disable all of the internet and technology on the whole planet?! What if this is just what the government wants us to think?! Meet up with me at the end of McKinley Avenue… we'll figure this out together, Aubrey.
