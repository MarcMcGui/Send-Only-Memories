Dear Marriah,
	After hearing the news of the world ending I figured that it was time enough that I tell you how I genuinely feel about you… the truth is that I have been in love with you since middle school. We grew closer in high school, but as we grew older, we also grew apart; by the time we graduated we had already lost so much of the closeness between us but my feelings never wavered. Though I was never sure of how you felt for me, I have carried a torch for you all these years… I know nothing will come of me telling you now but I could never forgive myself if I let the world end without you knowing how dear you are to me. I look forward to your letter of response with bated breath.
		Eternally Yours,
			Brian
