	Gran! Hi Gran, it's me Johnny. Momma said that you might be coming to stay with us and that is so awesome! I love it when I see you so I am happy to have you move in with us! It will be like a sleep over every single night!! I will make a fort for us all to sleep in together when you are here!! I love you Gran!
