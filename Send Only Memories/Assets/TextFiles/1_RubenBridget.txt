Bridget, alright I know that you will have no idea what I'm talking about but I need to tell you anyways. Two years ago when we were still working under that asshole Payton, I used you as my scapegoat. Terry had left a gorgeous slice of cheesecake in the fridge we had in the break room and I couldn't resist… I ate it. Then to make it worse, I lied and told him that you ate it. Terry has never held anything against you for it or anything but he has thought that you were the one all this time. I just thought that he would get overly upset with me if he knew the truth, but if it was you, he would just let it go. If you're wondering, yes, I have already told Terry the truth, I sent him a letter just the other day confessing. I hope the end finds you well, Bridget, you have always been so kind to everyone.
