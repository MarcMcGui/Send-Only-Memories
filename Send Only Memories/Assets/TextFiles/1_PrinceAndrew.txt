Dear Sir or Ma'am, 
I am mailing you most cordially for the great joy of spreading the great faith of Christianity, a thing I am very passionate about and very excited to be sharing with you. It is unfortunate to be saying this, but we are needing your help. In Nigeria, we have much collections operations in the Christian faith that have accumulated moneys totalling $10,000 USD. Unfortunately, we cannot use these moneys to be opening a chapter of our great church to our great Lord in the great United States of America without first transferring the funds to American accounts in smaller amounts, so to avoiding taxes to be levied upon this great amount. We humbly request your assistance in this matter by asking for your bank account card details and Social Security Numbers so that we can transfer a portion of this amount to your account for safe holding until we can open our great chapter in your United States. Please respond quickly, before the United States government attempts to levy taxes upon your share of this amount. 
	Prince Olufunmilola Jibola
