		Oh sweetheart, of course I'll come stay with you guys. Nothing would make me happier than to spend our final days together. You and the boys are my heart, I'm just glad that you've extended the invitation to move in for the time being. I don't need any help coming over though, it isn't very far and it isn't as if I need much stuff. I'll be over by the end of the week. The kid's letters were precious by the way, I'll be sure to write them both back soon. Stay safe until then, Susan, I love you.
