Emma, my love, it's Sydney… I can't believe that everything is going to be gone in just four months… I had so much planned for our future together. When we graduated this year I was going to propose… I already bought the ring actually. Emma, you're the greatest thing to ever happen to me and I simply cannot accept the fact that I have to lose you so soon. Trying to come to terms with all this is just so difficult… like is the Earth seriously going to be hit by a meteor by the end of February? I want to spend as much time with you as I can before this all goes down. Write back soon, if not then I'll be crossing town on foot to come see you. I love you so much, Emma.
