Hiya, Johnny! 
	I really liked reading your letter, dear. It made me smile so big because you're right, it will be like a long sleep over. A fort sounds like a wonderful idea, by the way, I bet you can make it extra cozy for my old bones. I'm so excited to see you, I just know my cheeks will be sore from all the smiles you will bring me during my stay. I will be with you so soon, by the end of the week in fact. Wait for me until then, Gran loves you Johnny.
