Hey Mom,
	The kids and I wanted to check in with you after we found out about the news. We were wondering if you had wanted to come stay with us until… you  know, the 20th of February. Ever since dad passed I know you said that you just wanted to live alone, but considering the circumstances, I feel like it may be wise to be together for now. I haven't let the kids in on the situation too much, no need to frighten them prematurely, so try not to mention it to them directly. The kids and I want to see you, mom. Let us know if you need help bringing stuff over. Oh yeah, and they want to send you letters of their own as well so expect those.
