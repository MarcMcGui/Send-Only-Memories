I'll be there, don't you even worry about it; your place at the start of the week. I'll bring the ring, then we can make our first stop be at a marriage courthouse. I will do right by you though, Emma. I'll get down on one knee and ask for your hand in marriage, full name and everything. Just wait for me, my love.
