Brian,
	Knowing that you placed so much importance on my response makes me a tad uncomfortable, how you feel when the world ends shouldn't be put on my shoulders. We haven't even spoken to one another in months so I don't know why you held me to such a standard, I can't save you and I can't give you peace… that is not my responsibility. It shouldn't have to be my problem whether or not you end your days in comfort, I care about you, yes, but it's clear that your attachment runs much deeper than mine. Also, please stop signing your letters like that, it doesn't feel right considering we aren't anything more than friends.
		Sincerely,
			Marriah
