To Our Respected Employee,
	As you have likely already heard through every news/media site known to man, our world will be coming to an end in just a matter of months; specifically on February 20th, 20xx. Until then we would like you to maintain business as usual and continue to deliver mail. Since mail traffic will likely increase during these next few months and not all of them will plausibly be able to get to everyone, we leave it to your discretion. Fill your weekly quota of letters to be delivered and fit what you can in your delivery routes. There will soon be no more internet access due to the EMP-like qualities of the incoming meteor and because of this, you will certainly have your work cut out for you. This makes your work more important now than ever before. Good Luck.
Chief Information Officer, Tim
