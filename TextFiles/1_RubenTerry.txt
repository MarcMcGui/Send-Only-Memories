	Okay I cannot believe I am actually writing this right now but hell, when else would I? Okay so Terry, do you remember two years ago when we were still both working under that asshole boss Payton? Well… one day you got super pissed that someone ate your cheesecake from the break room fridge and I told you that it was Bridget but dude the truth is… I ate it. I KNOW, I KNOW, I SHOULDN’T HAVE DONE IT BUT LISTEN, I was having a rough day and I saw it and man I just reeaalllyy wanted it. I told you it was Bridget because I knew you wouldn’t blow up at her or anything and it would just blow over so I thought that would be the end of it. Now that the world is going to end, I figured that I should face all my demons before I go and well, this is one of those things that I could just never forget about… I'm so sorry man. Anyways, Terry, I hope you aren't too upset with me; take care of yourself in these last months.
