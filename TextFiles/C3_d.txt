Sydney!
	I'm so glad that you like the idea this much, love. I think we should make this happen as soon as we possibly can to make sure we spend the maximum amount of time together that we can. To be married to the love of my life and spend our final months and moments with each other… that's all I could ask for. Let's meet up at my place at the start of next week and head out from there. Write me back confirming our meeting so that I know to be ready. I'll be preparing anyways though because I'm nearly sure of your answer.
