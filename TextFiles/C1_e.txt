Marriah,
	I am so sorry to have caused you to feel so uncomfortable, especially these days, but I couldn't just not let you know the full extent of my feelings for you. I see now that I went overboard and crossed a line… you are right, you don't owe me anything. It was in my own state of hopelessness that I reached such a point of dependency and reliance on an unreliable idea. I love you, Marriah and I hope you can smile and find joy all the way until the end of the line. This is my end, the only way I can accept going. Good bye, Marriah.
		Brian
