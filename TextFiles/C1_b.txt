Sweet Brian,
	Your letter came to me with great surprise, I have to say that I never expected it. We use to be best friends and I have always cared for you immensely but you're right, we grew apart. I suppose I just saw that as a sign that we were getting older and taking our own paths in life. I wasn't necessarily hurt that we became distant either, I accepted it. I'm sorry that I can't respond to you in the affirmative but I have never had romantic feelings for you, Brian. I have always and will continue to see you as just a friend whom I was once very close to.
		Best Wishes,
			Marriah
