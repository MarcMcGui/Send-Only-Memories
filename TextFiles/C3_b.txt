Syd,
	You were going to propose… oh my god, Sydney… What can we do? This situation feels so surreal and yet so terrifyingly real and impending at the same time. I just wish I could fall asleep and wake up in the morning like it hadn't happened at all, like it was just an awful nightmare. I don't even want to go to school, do you think they will cancel classes? I mean what is the point in going anyways, nothing will even matter in a few months. Wait, why don't we just run away together?! We could just grab small bags and leave, what could they do to us. Sydney, darling, lets escape this town and experience what a life of just us would be like. We could elope, I mean you already have the ring, I'll buy you one too. I love you to the moon and back, Syd.
